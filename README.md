# BungeeStatus
Sponge plugin to show server statuses on a network.

## What it does
Currently checks a (only mine) multicraft api to check if servers are online.
So it will only show my server unless someone makes his own api with multicraft.

It will send a 'broadcast' once a server goes offline or online.
People can do '/goonstatus' to see which server are online at that moment.

## Future plans
- Make it work with bungeecord
- The ability to create signs that show the status of a server and its players.
